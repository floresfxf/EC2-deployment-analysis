This data used to be publically available, however, Amazon now charges a fee. We will be working with the top 1m domains published in 2013 as a result. We extraced a list of subdomains from a dataset derived from the Alexa's 2013 Top 1m domains that contains all subdomains for each domain in the top 1m [http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~keqhe/imc2013/Alexa_subdomain_dns_records.tar.gz].

We are starting with a dataset of subdomains that already fit this description, but because this was generated in 2013, we must still reget all IP addresses and cross reference against amazon IP ranges for these subdomains to get the current cloud-using subdomains.**\n",
