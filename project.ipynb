    "The modernization of web services has recently been increasingly pushing for deployment in infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) clouds such as Amazon EC2, Windows Azure, and Rackspace. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a form of cloud computing that provides virtualized computing resources over the Internet, typically provided by a third-party provider hosts hardware, software, servers, storage and other infrastructure components on behalf of its users. IaaS providers also host users' applications and handle tasks including system maintenance, backup and resiliency planning. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud, that is usually known as the most popular IaaS cloud available.\n",

Our goal is to determine who is using EC2 Iaas Clouds using the UNIX dig command, which is used to query DNS servers for information on the domains obtained from the top 1 million domains, how these services are using the cloud using Amazonâ€™s publicly available IP ranges to determine how many regions are used,\n"
